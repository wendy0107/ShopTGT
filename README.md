<h2><b>Problem Description:</b></h2>
The original problem addressed in our cloud computing project was the challenge of meeting minimum requirements for discounts and promotions, both for physical and online purchases. Users frequently found themselves purchasing more than necessary to qualify for discounts, raising the question of how to connect with friends who share similar interests for collective purchases. Additionally, coordinating a group purchase, especially one involving various items and multiple buyers, proved to be a daunting task.

<h2><b>Proposed solution and rationale:</b></h2>
We aimed to focus the primary emphasis on users, striving to enhance the group buying experience. Consequently, our focus shifted towards the utility of creating group buys rather than attempting to create an "e-commerce" platform. We aimed to develop tools and a well-designed information system to facilitate easier group buying management, with a social platform envisioned as an additional feature in the future. Thus, our application places a greater emphasis on the process rather than the products, distinguishing it from commercial platforms.
